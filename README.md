# youtube-subtitle-transcriber

`youtube-subtitle-transcriber` is a specialized tool designed to generate subtitles from YouTube videos, particularly useful for handling non-English content. This project aims to streamline the process of extracting and converting spoken content from YouTube videos into readable text subtitles, with a focus on accuracy and ease of use.

## Key Features

- **YouTube Video Downloading**: Download videos directly from YouTube with ease.
- **Audio Extraction**: Extract high-quality audio from the downloaded videos.
- **Speech-to-Text Conversion**: Convert the extracted audio into text using advanced speech recognition, supporting multiple languages.
- **Subtitle Formatting**: Format the transcribed text into subtitle files (e.g., SRT) for various use cases, including educational and accessibility purposes.

## Future Enhancements

- **User Interface**: Develop a front-end interface to make the tool more user-friendly and accessible. This interface will allow users to input YouTube URLs, monitor the transcription progress, and download the final subtitle files directly from their browser.
- **Improved Pronunciation Accuracy**: Implement advanced speech recognition models and techniques to enhance the accuracy of transcriptions, especially for non-English languages. This will involve continuous updates and training of the models to handle diverse accents and pronunciations more effectively.
